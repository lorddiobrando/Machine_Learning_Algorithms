# Machine_Learning_Algorithms
Different machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch.

This Repository includes different machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch. The algorithms are: K-Nearest Neighbour, 
Oridinary Least Squares Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine with kernales (radial basis function).

Each algorithm is implemented on a Jupyter notebook using python. The datasets used on each algorithm are included within the 
algorithm's folder.
